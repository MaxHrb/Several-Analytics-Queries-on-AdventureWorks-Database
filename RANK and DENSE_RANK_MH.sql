RANK and DENSE_RANK - Exercises
Exercise 1


Using your solution query to Exercise 4 from the ROW_NUMBER exercises as a staring point, add a derived column called �Category Price Rank With Rank� that uses the RANK function to rank all products by ListPrice � within each category - in descending order. Observe the differences between the �Category Price Rank� and �Category Price Rank With Rank� fields.



Exercise 2


Modify your query from Exercise 2 by adding a derived column called "Category Price Rank With Dense Rank" that that uses the DENSE_RANK function to rank all products by ListPrice � within each category - in descending order. Observe the differences among the �Category Price Rank�, �Category Price Rank With Rank�, and �Category Price Rank With Dense Rank� fields.



Exercise 3


Examine the code you wrote to define the �Top 5 Price In Category� field, back in the ROW_NUMBER exercises. Now that you understand the differences among ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK, consider which of these functions would be most appropriate to return a true top 5 products by price, assuming we want to see the top 5 distinct prices AND we want �ties� (by price) to all share the same rank.
